INSTRUCTIONS TO SETUP AND RUN THE PREDICTOR

INSTALLATION
- Download the ner_predict.zip file on your local machine
- Unzip it
- Open the Terminal on Mac or open the Command Prompt on Windows. 
  For example download iTerm2 for Mac here: https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html 
  or see here for Windows 10: https://www.howtogeek.com/235101/10-ways-to-open-the-command-prompt-in-windows-10/ 
- Navigate via the command line to the ner_predict folder, for example if it's the Downloads folder on Mac, run the following:
	cd /Users/<your_username>/Downloads/ner_predict/
  or on Windows:
	cd C:\Users\<your_username>\downloads\ner_predict\
  but it depends where you place the ner_predict folder
- Make sure at least Python 3.6 is installed, run the following command:
	python --version
- If it outputs the version, and it's 3.6 or higher, then you are fine, otherwise go to the link below and follow the instructions there:
	https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Once Python 3 is installed, create a new virtual environment with the following command, on Mac and Linux:
	python3 -m venv ner_env
  if you are using Windows create the virtual enviroment with:
	py -m venv ner_env
  NOTE: if you are using Anaconda run instead:
        conda create -n ner_env python=3.6 anaconda
- Activate the newly created virtual environment (for virtualenv)  with:
	source ner_env/bin/activate
  if you are using Anaconda run instead:
	source activate ner_env 
- Install the dependencies with:
	pip install -r requirements.txt
- Add the EPPO API key token to your virtual environment by running the following command:
	export EPPO_TOKEN=eca38f6546816d4fd947a63018d38c27
  NOTE: this is my API key, you can add any API key generated after registering here: https://data.eppo.int/user/register
- You have completed the setup!

RUNNING THE PREDICTOR
- Place the input files to be predicted inside the folders: ner_predict/input_files/plant/ and ner_predict/input_files/animal/ for plant and animal health articles respectively
  NOTE: the files should be formatted exactly as specified in the Challenge Details, 
	they can be JSON or TXT files but the structure needs to follow the same of the files provided with the challenge
  NOTE: it is important that you place the files in the correct folder for plant and animal health articles respectively, otherwise the prediction will not work
- The result files will be automatically saved in the ner_predict/results/ folder in JSON format
- To run the script simply run in the command line (from inside the ner_predict folder):
	python predictor.py --normalize
  NOTE: the --normalize flag is optional, if you do not include it, normalization will not be performed and the process will be faster
